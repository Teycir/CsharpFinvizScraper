For installation instructions go to: http://insiderstracker.blogspot.com/2015/12/how-to-install-software.html
The code to create the database for 'insiders screener' module is within 'programfiles/SQL' folder of the installation package.
You can copy the folder 'tickers' within the installation package programfiles to your root://InsidersTracker/ folder that the software creates on the first usage, if you want to use my own created groups of tickers I use for the module 'money flow'.
